Key takeaways: I have learned mostly about importing and exporting files. When we export multiple functions, we use {funx1, funx2} and to import we use the same method as well.
Before exporting and importing, it is also important to remember that we need to write "type":"module" to the package.json. We have also explored some packages and installing them using npm install 'package'.
